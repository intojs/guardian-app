We did this interesting tennis refactoring kata by Emily Bache yesterday at work.

A group of 6 developers trying to untangle messy code, wonderful!

The kata was written in Java. Being a JavaScript developr and not a real engineer :), I decided to "contribute" from the side, being my vocal self.

You can imagine it did not take long until the guys parachuted me in the refactoring seat for about 10 minutes.

I have fiddled around with the syntax, having an overall sense that something's missing.

Later that evening, I have found myself drinking a beer with a friend and discussing Robert C. Martin's "Inversion of control" SOLID priciple.

During the complaining about the total lack of inspiration for my next article part of the evening, it struck me.

I will refactor the tennis game into a functional way, following the inversion of control principle, all in Javascript!

You see, our game has a few concepts all bundled together inside the game class.

The game has two players which represent it's state.

Let's imagine three developers will work together to create this masterpiece.

From Finland, Andy Scoresson to calculate the score of the tennis game.

From Englad Bill Playwell to handle the creation and management of the players.

And from USA, Frank GameLord to implement the game.
 
 
Frank is smart, be like Frank

He turn on his computer and starts thinking.

Mmmmm, I need a Game
